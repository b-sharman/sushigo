This project implements the popular card-drafting game [Sushi
Go](https://gamewright.com/product/Sushi-Go). Currently it is only playable
with a barebones textual user interface.

## Roadmap
1. Implement the scoring and gameplay logic of Sushi Go (complete)
1. Make a computer player that interfaces with that logic (in progress)
1. Refactor the project into a serverâ€“client model to allow any player to
   connect to a game via an as-of-yet-undecided network protocol (not started)
1. Make a nice-looking frontend for human players (not started)
